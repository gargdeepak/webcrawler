Requirements:
1. python 3.6.7
2. pip3


Before you run the crawler.py script:
1. Please make sure you have pip3 upgraded
2. Please create a venv by the name of venv using python3 - $ python3 -m venv venv
3. You can either explicitly use the python 3 interpreter to run the script otherwise, it will try to look for one in the venv directory
4. Please install the dependent packages:  $pip install -r requirements.txt
5. You are now good to go. Enjoy :)
